								<h2>The internet</h2>
								<p>
								The internet has never had a center. It started when two computers were connected
								together, and expanded as more machines were added.
								</p>

								<p>
								In essence, all those machines are equal. Some are large, like the university
								mainframes that were the first computers on the internet, or the servers in data
								centers, and some are small, like your phone.
								But each machine that's connected to the internet is in principle able to function
								as a server (like hosting a website), or as a client (like browsing a website), or a
								network router, though some machines are more fit for some roles than others.
								</p>

								<p>
								In addition to this, the internet is also very resilient. Because many different 
								routes can be made between your machine and a machine on the other side of the
								world, if one of the routers in between gets disconnected, the network will send
								your packages through a different route, and you probably wouldn't even notice.
								</p>

								<h3>A centralised internet</h3>
								<p>
								The decentralised character of the internet is what makes it so powerful. It makes
								it very difficult for someone to prevent you from accessing a specific web service
								without preventing your access altogether.
								</p>

								<p>
								<a id="four-websites"
										href="https://nitter.net/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136"><img
										src="assets/four-websites.png" alt="David Masad @badnetworker 28 May 2019
1999: there are millions of websites all hyperlinked together
2019: there are four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three." /></a>
								One of the ways someone can try to prevent you from accessing a website is by
								blocking a service's DNS. This becomes a bigger problem as a larger more of the
								internet is hosted on fewer domains.
								</p>

								<p>
								Since domain names have to be unique, they are centrally registered. And while there
								are multiple DNS servers and a lot of redundancy built into the system, it remains
								controlled by a central authority, and in a way a single point of failure.
								</p>

								<p>
								Another way in which the internet is not very decentralised, is that large parts of
								the internet run on the servers of a few large cloud platforms. But if a cloud
								platform decides to evict your website from their servers, you can always move it to
								a different server.
								</p>

								<p>
								In order to be able to move to a different server, it is important that you can use
								the same tools you had on the original platform. To do this, it helps if the tools
								you use are <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/">free software</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
								Another important condition is that the server to which you move your website is
								treated the same by the internet service providers. If an ISP runs a competitor to
								your website, they may be motivated to sabotage your website by making it slower
								for their clients. That's why it's important to have <a
												href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">network neutrality</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>The Fediverse</h3>
								<p>
								The fediverse is a collection of protocols, applications, servers, websites, and
								people that function in a decentralised way. The idea of the fediverse is that there
								is not a central entity, such as Twitter or TikTok at the center of social
								interaction, but a whole network of independent yet interconnected, i.e. federated
								services.
								</p>

								<p>
								A concrete example of federation, that anyone using the internet is familiar with,
								is email. Email is not a website or a company, but a protocol (or rather a set of
								protocols). There are different servers with different hostnames that provide email,
								and you don't need to be on the same server to send emails to other people. You can
								use web interfaces or different mobile applications to access your email, and with
								enough know-how you can set up your own email server that federates with other
								servers.
								</p>

								<p>
								A large part of the fediverse uses <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>. This includes <a
										href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> (similar to Twitter), <a
										href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> and <a
										href="https://kbin.pub/en">kbin</a>
								(similar to Reddit), <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> (similar to
								Instagram), <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> (a video platform), and
								many more.
								</p>

								<p>
								When you are on one Mastodon server (instance), you can interact with people on a
								different instance. But because these platforms all use ActivityPub, you can even
								interact with Pixelfed or PeerTube users. Some protocols don't use ActivityPub,
								such as <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> (secure chat platform) can't
								interact with other platforms, but some platforms, such as <a
										href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspora*</a>Can interact with certain
								ActivityPub platforms.
								</p>

								<p>
								When looking at for example the Join Mastodon website, you'll often see a list of
								<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">servers</a> and a list of <a
									 href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">apps</a>, because everyone can add a server
							  or create an app to interact with the network. Mastodon even allows you to move your
								contacts to an account on a different server.
								</p>

								<h3>Fruity Owl</h3>
								<p>
								So why does this web page look like this? For no other reason than that it reminds
								me of what the internet was before big money had entered the space, and decided what
								good web design looks like, while also not throwing everything out that we learned
								along the way.
								</p>

								<p>
								The logos at the top represent two cherries and an owl for no particular reason,
								other than that it goes with the name Fruity Owl.
