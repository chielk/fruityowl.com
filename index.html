								<h2>The internet</h2>
								<p>
								The internet has never had a center. It started when two computers were
								connected together, and expanded as more machines were added.
								</p>

								<p>
								In essence, all those machines are equal. Some are large, like the university
								mainframes that were the first computers on the internet, or the servers in
								data centers, and some are small, like your phone.
								But each machine that's connected to the internet is in principle able to
								function as a server (like hosting a website), or as a client (like browsing a
								website), or a network router, though some machines are more fit for some roles
								than others.
								</p>

								<p>
								In addition to this, the internet is also very resilient. Because many different 
								routes can be made between your machine and a machine on the other side of the
								world, if one of the routers in the middle suddenly gets disconnected, the
								network will send your packages through a different route, and you probably
								wouldn't even notice.
								</p>

								<h3>A decentralised internet</h3>
								<p>
								The decentralised character of the internet, is what makes it so powerful. It
								makes it very difficult for someone to prevent you from accessing a specific
								web service.
								</p>

								<p>
								One of the ways someone can try to prevent you from accessing a website is by
								blocking a service's DNS.
								</p>

								<p>
								Since domain names have to be unique, they are centrally registered. And while
								there are multiple DNS servers and a lot of redundancy built into the system,
								it remains a central authority, and in a way a single point of failure.
								</p>

								<p>
								Another way in which the internet is not very decentralised, is that large
								parts of the internet run on the servers of a few large cloud platforms. But if
								a cloud platform decides to evict your website from their servers, you can
								always move it to a different server.
								</p>

								<p>
								In order to be able to move to a different server, it is important that you can
								use the same tools you had on the original platform. To do this, it helps if
								the tools you use are <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/">free software</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
								Another important condition is that the server to which you move your website
								is treated the same by the internet service providers. If an ISP runs a
								competitor to your website, they may be motivated to sabotage your website by
								making it slower for their clients. That's why it's important to have 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">network neutrality</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>The future of the internet</h3>
								<p>
								While common sense would dictate that you need a central authority if we all
								want to agree on a source of truth (like DNS), this is not actually the case.
								When Satoshi Nakamoto created <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>, he
								created a way for computers to agree on what is true, without a central
								authority, that is also resilient to to attackers.
								And while the Bitcoin blockchain is entirely transparent, there are also
								projects like <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> which hides the
								amounts, sources, and destinations of transactions. Other projects focus on
								decentralised finance, with the intention of removing the central point of
								failure (such as exchanges) from the equation.
								</p>

								<p>
								Other projects, such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> and 
								<a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> can do addressing without relying on DNS
								or IP addresses, while also protecting the user's privacy with cryptography.
								This allows users to circumvent censors and blockades.
								</p>

								<p>
								While internet privacy can be used by bad actors for nefarious activities, it
								also helps to protect the rust of us online. If we would remove those
								protections we would open the door to much more trouble than we would prevent.
								And now that it exists, it can no longer be taken away, so it's better to focus
								on what people do with technology than the technology itself.
								</p>

								<h3>Fruity Owl</h3>
								<p>
								So why does this web page look like this? For no other reason than that it
								reminds me of what the internet was before big money had entered the space, and
								decided what good web design looks like, while also not throwing everything out
								that we learned along the way.

								The logos at the top represent two cherries and an owl for no particular
								reason, other than that it goes with the name Fruity Owl.
